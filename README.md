## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diy-cctv-yolo.git
cd diy-cctv-yolo
2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually:

pip install opencv-python ultralytics twilio
📡 Setup IP Webcam
Install IP Webcam app on your phone
Start the server
Note the streaming URL:
http://<phone-ip>:8080/video
Ensure:
Phone & laptop are on same WiFi
Stream works in browser
🔐 Configure Twilio

Update credentials inside the script:

account_sid = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID"
auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
twilio_number = "+1234567890"
your_number = "+91XXXXXXXXXX"
▶️ Run the Project
python diy_cctv_yolo.py

Press q to exit.

🧠 Detection Logic
Uses pretrained model: yolov8n.pt
Detects only person class (class = 0)
SMS sent only when:
if person_detected and (current_time - last_sent_time > cooldown):
⚠️ Important Notes
Twilio trial account:
Only sends SMS to verified numbers
Adds trial prefix to messages
Keep cooldown enabled to avoid SMS spam 💸
Internet connection required for Twilio API
🔐 Security Best Practices

❌ Avoid hardcoding credentials:

account_sid = "..."
auth_token = "..."

✅ Use environment variables:

set TWILIO_SID=your_sid
set TWILIO_AUTH=your_auth_token
🔮 Future Enhancements
📸 Send image snapshot with alert
🧠 Face recognition (known vs unknown)
📊 People counting system
🌙 Night vision detection
📲 Telegram/Email alerts (free alternative)
☁️ Cloud logging and dashboard
🐞 Known Issues
HTTP stream may lag depending on network
High CPU usage on low-end machines
SMS delay depends on network & Twilio
